# BUParsum

The project BUParsum aims to offer a solution to the lack of high-quality language data to be used in NLP studies, showing the frequency of morphological or syntactic features of the languages. 

BUParsum uses the default language datasets retrieved from the Universal Dependencies and provides a chart that demonstrates the distribution of given syntactic and morphological features as output. 

#How to Use

The first thing you need to do is to provide BUParsum with a language that is listed in the menu. Then all you need to do is to enter which feature(s) you want BUParsum to count and BuParsum will return a graphic of statistical analysis. Please do not forget to use commas in-between if you enter more than one language or feature, e.g. 1, 2 or DET, Definite. If you want to look up other language pairs or features, kindly refresh the page and start all over. 

#Supported Languages:
 [1] English 
 [2] German 
 [3] Turkish 
 [4] French 
 [5] Spanish
